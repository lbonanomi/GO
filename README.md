## What's This?

I'm porting my legacy [script grab-bag](https://github.com/lbonanomi/scripts/blob/master/README.md) to GOLANG as a learning exercise and adding a few new items as I go. The code quality is probably abysmal, but I learn best by doing.

This repository is on the bag-of-scripts model as opposed to an importable `go get` format because I only ever need one script at a time.
